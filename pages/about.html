Being a self-taught designer from Hong Kong, it is only passion that could lead her all the way to London, one of the most vibrant, dynamic city of design.</p><p>I always think it’s my luck to truly reveal my strong interest in art and design during my university time. I did like to draw and create things since I was young but the society always persuades people to walk a comfort and guaranteed path. Soon after obtaining my Bachelor degree of Science, in the crossroads of Should and Must, I ignited my career as a web designer. Now, with over 7 years of experience in different roles, ranging from Product Design, UI Designer to Assistant Art Director, works varying from digital product design, graphic design and motion design, whcih are all fueled by the pursuit of communicating concepts in a simple and appropriate way.</p></div></div></div><div class=col-sm-12><div class="col-md-2 col-md-offset-2"><div class="title h3 right">More about myself?</div></div><div class=col-md-6><div class=content><p>Born and raised in an international city like Hong Kong, I am able to speak fluent English and Cantonese, some Mandarin plus some Japanese ! (Being a huge fan of a Japanese band for years is one of my motivation for learning Japanese and they are a great inspirer to my life) The perk of having strong interests in languages is one could get more chance to talk to people in different cultures, and it’s always beneficial to design thinking.</p><p>I spend my time playing with <a href=http://dribbble.com/kichipun target=_blank>pixels, strokes and lines</a>, sometimes with codes or <a href=https://medium.com/@kichipun target=_blank>words</a>. I’m a stationery freak, also obsessed with bandsound and often found in gigs.</p>Always have strong interest in motion graphics and now taking a <a href="https://www.skillshare.com/classes/design/Simple-Character-Animation/1750772942/classroom/discussions?via=loggedin-home-enrolled&autoPlay=1&enrolledRedirect=1" target=_blank>motion graphics course on Skillshare<a>.<p>Co-founded <a href=http://facebook.com/hkgoodstore target=_blank>Hong Kong Good Store</a> with friends in 2012, a non-commercial project aims at reinforcing the values of independent local stores in Hong Kong.
